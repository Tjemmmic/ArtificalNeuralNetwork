# ArtificalNeuralNetwork
Artificial Neural Network using Verilog to take a written digit and convert it to its numerical value utilizing an FPGA. This is my final project for the course ECE 428 Programmable ASIC Design at SIUC.

In addition to the project itself, I wrote a python script to perform the same calculations with the hex values used in the Verilog project to verify the project's accuracy.
